# HMI-based-robotic-arm
A gesture-controlled 6-DOF robotic arm powered by a Human-Machine Interface glove embedded with flex sensors and IMUs. It captures real-time hand movements and transmits data wirelessly via Bluetooth to an Arduino-based system that drives precise robotic motion. Designed for intuitive control, remote operation, and human-robot interaction.
